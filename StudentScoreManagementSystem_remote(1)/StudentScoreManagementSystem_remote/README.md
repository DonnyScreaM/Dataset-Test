# Student Score Management System

I create a web app "Student Score Management System" that relies upon a MongoDB database and flask.



## System Introduction

This system can manage the student's grade information and provides the following functions:

1. Provides an input interface for student information, including student ID, name, and grades.

2. Provide student information query interface. Visually display the information of each student in the form of a table. The default is to sort by student number from small to large.

3. Support personalized query operations. You can query by name, id, score, and five operations(=, <, >, <=, >=) are supported. Remember that your query should contain no spaces. For each user query, a legality judgment will be made .

4. Edit operations are supported. Each row of data records can be edited to update the student ID, name, and grade information in the database.

5. Delete operations are supported. Each row of student data supports one-click deletion.
